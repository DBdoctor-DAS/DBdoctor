# DBdoctor launches Agent-free lightweight management solution

## Background
In the digital age, databases are at the core of information systems, and their security, stability, and efficiency are crucial. For businesses that are sensitive to data and require high confidentiality, there are stricter requirements for database permission management and security processes. When these users face database performance issues, they are often unable to use tools that deploy agents to collect data and execute commands, making it difficult to quickly identify and resolve problems, which is a source of frustration!

To address this issue, DBdoctor has now launched a lightweight agentless database management solution, allowing users to quickly manage instances without installing an agent!

## DBdoctor launches Agent-free lightweight management solution

The agentless lightweight database management method from DBdoctor simplifies the deployment process and enables quick database performance diagnostics.

### Solution Advantages:

- Lightweight deployment, quick instance management
- No need to install agents, eliminating dependencies on kernel versions and CPU architectures
- After management, you can access features such as **SQL audit, index recommendation, instance inspection, performance insights, and basic monitoring**.

### Instance Management Method:

Once the basic database information has been validated, select the [Agentless] option for data collection and click submit to complete agentless instance management. This method avoids installing an agent on the target machine.

**Note**: Metrics such as CPU, diskIO, MEM, and diskSize rely on agent collection, so features like performance insights, instance inspection, and basic monitoring will be limited.

## What Features Can Be Experienced With Agentless Management?

### 1. Full SQL Audit Functionality
- Unlock manual audit, slow SQL audit, and OpenAPI audit
- Unlock index recommendation feature
- As shown in the image below, users can perform rule audits and performance audits on batch SQL submissions.

### 2. Instance Inspection Functionality

- The inspection function can be used normally. By clicking the [Start Inspection] button, you can trigger the inspection function, wait for the inspection report, and view the inspection results.
- Experience features such as inspection overview, monitoring status summary, configuration issues, resource issues, and performance trends.

### 3. Performance Insights Functionality

Using AAS data and slow SQL, we can also analyze business problems and identify root cause SQL. As shown in the image below, when a business experiences a lag at a specific time, DBdoctor can identify the root cause SQL through the AAS spike.

### 4. Basic Monitoring Functionality

Agentless managed instances can still use basic monitoring. Since metrics like CPU, diskIO, MEM, and diskSize are collected by agents, these indicators cannot be displayed, but other functions remain unaffected.

## Conclusion

DBdoctor's agentless data collection method offers significant advantages in simplifying deployment, enhancing compatibility, improving security, and enabling quick integration and expansion. This solution provides more efficient, secure, and convenient database performance diagnostic services for industries like finance that have specific data security requirements. With agentless instance management, users can quickly experience features such as SQL audits and performance insights. However, due to collection limitations, some features like Lock Insights, Audit Logs, and Root Cause Analysis will be restricted. Therefore, to experience the full range of DBdoctorâ€™s features, it is still recommended to manage instances via agent-based methods.
